# Newspaper-Image-Search

# The purpose of this program is to take a zip file of photos,
# search those photos for user-specified text (e.g. names), and
# then return the faces of any individuals contained on that page.

# The program uses openCV for face detection,
# pytesseract for optical character recognition,
# PIL to create the display/report of faces found (if any).

# Each of the photos used is a PNG image of a newspaper page and they are
# located in the small_img.zip and images.zip files found in the repository.
# These newspapers are in english, and contain a variety of stories,
# advertisements and images.

# Note: The large file (images.zip) can take some time to process.
